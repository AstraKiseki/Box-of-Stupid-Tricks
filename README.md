# Box-of-Stupid-Tricks
A repository of different little tricks I've used in other projects, all packed into one box.  Lots of Methods will be included.

(It's also how I'm keeping up with my commit streak!)

## Pseudo-table of Contents
### Letter Methods (most often for strings)
### Number Methods (for integers and other math related stuff)
### Cover Letter Box (A spot for some of my cover letters, depending on what I need.)
