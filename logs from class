Organization-wise, should I start with Core or Data?

cameronwilby [12:33 PM] 
Core, then Data

astrakiseki [12:33 PM] 
Awesome.  Making Domain, then Models, then Repository, and Infrastructure?

[12:34] 
(And it'd be an ASP.net web project?)

cameronwilby [12:35 PM] 
yep

[12:35] 
actually, the process looks more like this

[12:35] 
- Core.Domain
- Data.Infrastructure (So you can build the database using the classes you just added in Core.Domain)
- Core.Models
- Core.Repository
- Data.Repository (edited)

astrakiseki [12:37 PM] 
And open it as an empty project with stuff for web api?

astrakiseki [12:52 PM] 
(Is each opened with a new ASP.net web project?)

astrakiseki [12:58 PM] 
Or is it classes or...?

cameronwilby [12:59 PM] 
No, core and data are class libraries

[1:00] 
API is a web API project

astrakiseki [1:01 PM] 
So the snowflake main would be a web API project, and Core, Data are both class libraries, Web is well, a new web page, and test is...?

cameronwilby [1:02 PM] 
a unit test project

astrakiseki [1:02 PM] 
k!

[1:02] 
Annnnd now I made VS crash and cry.

[1:04] 
What is the difference between a class library and a class library (package)?

[1:05] 
Necessary NuGet packages will be...?

[1:09] 
I assume Cors, ASP.net Identity, AutoMapper, Oauth, um, what else... entity framework...

cameronwilby [1:22 PM] 
class library package is for making a nuget package

[1:23] 
class library is for making a class library in a project

[1:23] 
yeah

astrakiseki [1:28 PM] 
That's all of them at the moment?

astrakiseki [1:44 PM] 
Which ASP.net packages do I grab?

astrakiseki [2:18 PM] 
added a Plain Text snippet 
Fluff log from another thing last night with friends:
// Arguments: // callback - (Function) The aforementioned callback function. The first // argument is the Swallow  If true, log to console

How do you set the length of a string?  Or will I have to do varchar and then a second string?

astrakiseki [2:50 PM] 
Hm, and an array of userIds would be phrased as?

astrakiseki [3:05 PM] 
Which ones need a virtual collection?

astrakiseki [3:56 PM] 
... the ones that have many.

cameronwilby [4:43 PM] 
that would be something you limit on the frontend

astrakiseki [4:44 PM] 
And how would I approach the 'these people have chosen this thought'?

cameronwilby [4:52 PM] 
sorry, I was answering "How do you set the length of a string?"

astrakiseki [4:52 PM] 
That's what I thought.

cameronwilby [4:52 PM] 
How you would approach "these people have chosen this thought" is the one i'm thinking about now

astrakiseki [4:52 PM] 
Okay dokie.

[4:53] 
I was thinking an array with a .Where

[4:53] 
But that might end up too big in time?

P.S. Mine's simple, it's just trying to fully understand how to map the model builder.

astrakiseki [12:50 PM] 
Should I just go get lunch now?

cameronwilby [12:59 PM] 
everybody has gone to lunch

[12:59] 
so you’re next in line

[12:59] 
wanna jump in the office?

astrakiseki [12:59 PM] 
Okay dokie, be right there.

astrakiseki [2:29 PM] 
Which video is the one involving the unit of work stuff?

cameronwilby [2:56 PM] 
hmm, not sure - what do you need to know about it? (it’s a fairly simple class after all)

astrakiseki [2:56 PM] 
Curiosity due to me noticing it in Wingman while opening up controllers.

astrakiseki [3:59 PM] 
Current Issue: How to configure the ParticipationsController when it has a composite key and it wants to know where its ID is?

astrakiseki [12:37 PM] 
Which Owin do I grab?

astrakiseki [12:45 PM] 
And I think the trouble right now is an 'ordinary' anxiety flare.  No causes or anything, it's just an obnoxious wave of nervousness that I have to wait out.

astrakiseki [10:25 AM] 
I uh, think I deleted something I shouldn't have again.

cameronwilby [10:27 AM] 
Lol what did you delete?

astrakiseki [10:28 AM] 
Nevermind, I fixed it.  I had deleted my migrations but couldn't build to fix.

[10:28] 
So I went into my recycling bin and hit restore.

[10:28] 
(Well, restore the ONE THING I had deleted.)

astrakiseki [10:33 AM] 
Shaved down a bunch of my errors but there's three I'm still poking at.

[10:36] 
but brb bathroom

astrakiseki [11:02 AM] 
"Define the key for this EntityType."  For UserRole.

[11:02] 
So I guess I just use Key?

astrakiseki [11:10 AM] 
THIS IS GETTING SILLY.  New problem now, involves Data apparently not existing?

astrakiseki [11:46 AM] 
Got it fixed!

astrakiseki [7:18 PM] 
So how to arrange the meetings?


----- March 15th -----
astrakiseki [9:18 AM] 
How do you want to arrange the Wednesday meeting?

astrakiseki [9:28 AM] 
Scratch that, it was a miscommunication!

Now I get why you were nudging for an angular version.  I'm not sure how to approach putting the controller in.

astrakiseki [9:00 AM] 
also, uh, wouldn't ng-click be the function we need for the swipe thing?

astrakiseki [9:32 AM] 
(Also can I have the code you wrote up for the swiping to see if I can get it to work?)

astrakiseki [10:40 AM] 
Pinging for the inquiry.

cameronwilby [11:22 AM] 
sorry was with a student

astrakiseki [11:22 AM] 
Ah!

cameronwilby [11:22 AM] 
so I didn't actually accomplish much with the code we wrote yesterday - i would say take a look at this library and see if you can get it to work

My brain is hitting a blank, so I'm asking to see if I know how to approach this stuff mentally.
To get a new page working on the web, the order is
the ctrl.js page, then the html, then add to the app.js?

cameronwilby [9:41 AM] 
yep -

`Write the Angular Controller`
`Create the html file in the Templates folder`
`Add a state to the app.js file - give the state a name and point to the Controller + Template`
