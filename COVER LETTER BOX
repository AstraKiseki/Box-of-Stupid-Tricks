To whom it may concern, (Remove this!  Find a proper name to work with.)

(next time, remember to put in where you found the ad, how you found the company, maybe your opinion.)

I have noticed you are seeking a junior software developer.  A fresh outlook outside of the computer science fields would be useful, and that is something I have!  My degree in microbiology is focused on diseases, so one could say I have more awareness of bug-fixing beyond the normal, if you'd pardon the pun, and my ongoing education in software has shown me to have a head for trouble-shooting, ranging from noticing issues with Slack and code snippets, finding coding typos, and quickly finding the problems that my group and I have within our programming.   Meanwhile, my other line of work has given me experience with confidentiality agreements and non-disclosure agreements, as well as in effective communication.

I am a local to San Diego, in fact, I live in the heart of the county in Mira Mesa, and I would love to come in for an interview.  It would be also a pleasure to meet over coffee to better understand the company culture.  My number is (HIDDEN DUE TO INTERNET), with the best times to be in the morning and afternoon between the hours of 9 am and 5 pm.  Thank you for your time!


Sincerely,



R. Mooney
