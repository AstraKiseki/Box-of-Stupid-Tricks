To whom it may concern,

I have noticed you are seeking a junior software developer.  Perhaps a fresh outlook outside of the computer science fields would be useful, and that is something I have!  My degree in microbiology is focused on diseases, so one could say I have more awareness of bug-fixing beyond the normal, if you'd pardon the pun, and my ongoing education in software has shown me to have a head for trouble-shooting that'd prove quite useful as I continue to learn.   Meanwhile, my other line of work has given me experience with confidentiality agreements and non-disclosure agreements, as well as in effective communication.

There is more I can show you beyond my resume and this cover letter, all it'd need is an interview or two.  I am a local to San Diego, in fact, I live in the heart of the county in Mira Mesa, and can easily visit for interviews.  I'd love to come in, and you'd find me a joy to have.  Thank you for your time!
