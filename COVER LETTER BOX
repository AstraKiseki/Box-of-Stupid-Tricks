To whom it may concern,

I have noticed you are seeking a junior software developer.  Perhaps a fresh outlook outside of the computer science fields would be useful, and that is something I have!  My degree in microbiology is focused on diseases, so one could say I have more awareness of bug-fixing beyond the normal, if you'd pardon the pun, and my ongoing education in software has shown me to have a head for trouble-shooting that'd prove quite useful as I continue to learn.   Meanwhile, my other line of work has given me experience with confidentiality agreements and non-disclosure agreements, as well as in effective communication.

There is more I can show you beyond my resume and this cover letter, all it'd need is an interview or two.  I am a local to San Diego, in fact, I live in the heart of the county in Mira Mesa, and can easily visit both the Scripps Ranch and Sorrento Valley locations.  I'd love to come in, and you'd find me a joy to have.  Thank you for your time!
